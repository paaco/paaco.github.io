# 6502

Ramblings about 6502 code optimization and tricks used and figured out when developing stuff.


## Functions

* Since there are only 3 registers, functions can be most easily reused if they only use 1 or at most 2 registers as input parameters:

    * `A` is most appropriate for a value, since `A` is almost always clobbered anyway.

    * `X` or `Y` are most appropriate for when indexing into a table.


## Size optimization tricks

* When a function would end with `jsr` + `rts`, replace it with `jmp` instead, saving 1 byte, avoiding stack usage and avoiding 6 cycles for `rts`.

* Put functions in front of other functions to fall through instead of `jmp` saving 3 bytes.

* Put an often used parameter setup like `lda #0` in front of a function, saving 2 bytes per `jsr` call.

* Use branches (e.g. `beq`) on known conditions ("always") instead of `jmp`, saving 1 byte. The speed is the same, unless the branch is to another page (different high byte).

* When branching to an `rts` to end a function, branch to an existing `rts`, possibly saving 1 byte.

* Saving/restoring `A` is easily done with `pha` (3 cycles) / `pla` (4 cycles), costing only 2 bytes, just slow to do in a loop.
`STA $FF` (3 cycles) / `LDA $FF` (3 cycles) is an alternative but that uses a byte in ZP.
